# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

- The Drowsy Driver Detection System has been formulated utilizing non-intrusive machine vision principles. 
- The apparatus incorporates a compact monochromatic security camera oriented towards the driver's facial region, enabling continuous scrutiny of the driver's ocular activity to discern signs of fatigue.
- In instances where indications of fatigue are identified, the system generates a cautionary signal designed to promptly apprise the driver. 
- The ensuing document expounds upon the methodology for eye localization as well as the technique for discriminating between open and closed ocular states.
